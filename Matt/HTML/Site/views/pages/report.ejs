            <ul>
                <li>Writing the HTML code for our website taught us the importance of correctly structuring and tagging HTML elements,
                otherwise the page and its corresponding style sheet quickly become difficult to format. This was a steep learning curve
                but by the end, we are both happy with our ability to create a nicely-formatted, readable website.</li>
                <li>The EJS framework was adopted to deliver pages using partials as templates (i.e. the head, header, and footer sections). Prior to
                this, the code was repeated for every page which wasn't sustainable or good practice.</li>
                <li>The Bootstrap 4 framework was implemented, giving access to its wide range of pre-built components and allowing seamless,
                responsive web-pages to be created.</li>
                <li>Bootstrap also allows elements to reformat depending on the window size to accommodate mobile and desktop users. This can be seen
                 in the navigation bar, the <a href="/learnhome" class="report-text-link">Learn - Home</a> page, and across the website - when
                 the window is resized the web pages remain readable and aesthetic</li>

        <div class = "report-text">
            <ul>
                <li>CSS selectors were used to personalise the style of the website, taking advantage of the
                  id and class tags to customise certain elements. Structuring the style sheet quickly became important because of how
                  many different tags were required, and so a sensible order and naming convention was used to make style.css readable. </li>
                <li>The Bootstrap 4 framework provided a significant amount of styling tools, allowing pages to quickly look aesthetic and professional
                 with a single selector. These selectors were then modified to customise elements of the website and create a consistent style.</li>

                smaller functions to capture user login information from the navigation bar.</li>
                <li>We have used the javascript anime.js and jQuery library for client-side animations, such as the section loading animation on this page.</li>
